1. Create one file for ex. test.txt that contains actual data.
2. Create one another metadata file which contains respective version data of the actual file.
3. At a time only one line can be appended at the end or one line can be delated from anywhere.


Steps:
1. python svc_v1.py test.txt

  This line when executed create new version if and only if new line is appended or deleted.
  If changes are not found it gives msg:"Already Commited"
  
2 python svc_v1.py N

  Here N may be any version number from 1 to N , above command when executed output contains
  the respective version data from the metadata file.
  
  ex:python svc_v1.py 1  // It gives version 1 data of the file
     python svc_v1.py 2  // It gives version 2 data of the file
